# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for development and release management.

## Release Script

### `release.sh`

Automates the process of creating a new release using **trunk-based development** with automatic release branch creation and proper semantic versioning.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
./scripts/release.sh patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
./scripts/release.sh minor

# Major release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
./scripts/release.sh major

# Default is patch if no argument provided
./scripts/release.sh
```

**Trunk-Based Development Workflow:**

1. ‚úÖ Validates you're on the `main` branch (trunk)
2. ‚úÖ Ensures working directory is clean
3. ‚úÖ Pulls latest changes from `main` (trunk)
4. ‚úÖ Calculates new version based on semver
5. ‚úÖ **Creates release branch**: `release/v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`
6. ‚úÖ Updates `package.json` version
7. ‚úÖ Runs tests and linting
8. ‚úÖ Builds the project
9. ‚úÖ Commits version bump to release branch
10. ‚úÖ Creates and pushes Git tag
11. ‚úÖ Pushes release branch for PR creation
12. ‚úÖ Provides next steps for merge workflow

**Prerequisites:**

- Git repository with `main` branch
- Clean working directory
- All changes committed and pushed to `main`
- Optional: `semver` npm package for better version calculation
  ```bash
  npm install -g semver
  ```

**Release Branch Workflow:**

The script follows trunk-based development best practices:

1. **Start from main**: Always create releases from the stable `main` branch
2. **Automatic branch creation**: Creates `release/v{version}` branches automatically
3. **Short-lived branches**: Release branches are temporary for final testing
4. **PR-based merging**: Release branches merge back to main via Pull Request
5. **Tag-triggered deployment**: Git tags trigger automated CI/CD workflows

**After running:**

1. **Review the release branch**: `release/v{version}` is created and pushed
2. **Create Pull Request**: From `release/v{version}` ‚Üí `main`
3. **Final review**: Team reviews the release changes
4. **Merge to main**: Approving the PR merges changes back to trunk
5. **Automated deployment**: The Git tag triggers GitHub Actions workflows:
   - üß™ Run tests and quality checks
   - üì¶ Publish to GitHub Packages (npm)
   - üê≥ Build and push Docker image to GHCR
   - üåê Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - üìã Create GitHub Release with artifacts

**Example Release Flow:**

```bash
# On main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create release (e.g., 1.2.3 ‚Üí 1.2.4)
./scripts/release.sh patch

# Script creates: release/v1.2.4 branch
# Creates: v1.2.4 tag
# Pushes both to origin

# Next: Create PR from release/v1.2.4 ‚Üí main
# After merge: GitHub Actions deploys v1.2.4
```

## Manual Release Process

If you prefer to create releases manually:

1. **Update version in package.json:**

   ```bash
   npm version patch  # or minor, major
   ```

2. **Create and push tag:**

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

3. **The release workflow will trigger automatically**

## Version Strategy

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Channels

1. **Development Builds (main branch):**
   - Dev versions: `0.0.0-dev.abc123f`
   - Tags: `dev`, `latest` (overwritten each push)
   - Triggered on every push to `main`
   - **Benefits**: No registry pollution, always latest dev build

2. **Semantic Releases (tags):**
   - Semantic versions: `1.2.3`
   - Tags: `v1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`, `latest`
   - Triggered on Git tags matching `v*.*.*`

### Artifacts

Each release produces:

- **npm package**: `@{owner}/dracula-palette@{version}`
- **Docker image**: `ghcr.io/{repo}:{version}`
- **GitHub Pages**: `https://{owner}.github.io/dracula-palette/`
- **GitHub Release**: With source code and build artifacts

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Install latest stable release
npm install @anselmoo/dracula-palette@latest

# Install latest development build (from main branch)
npm install @anselmoo/dracula-palette@dev

# Pull stable Docker image
docker pull ghcr.io/anselmoo/dracula-palette:latest

# Pull development Docker image
docker pull ghcr.io/anselmoo/dracula-palette:dev
```

**Development builds** are perfect for:

- Testing latest features before release
- Integration testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Early feedback and bug reports

**Stable releases** are recommended for:

- Production deployments
- Documentation and tutorials
- Long-term projects
