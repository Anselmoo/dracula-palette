# Lorem Ipsum Analyzer - Enhanced Features

## Overview

The Lorem Ipsum Analyzer component has been enhanced with color selection and variable text length controls, allowing users to preview text with specific palette colors and customize the amount of generated text.

## New Features

### 1. Color Selection Controls

Users can now select specific palette colors for different text elements in the preview:

- **Heading Color**: Choose a color for the sample heading
- **Strong Color**: Choose a color for bold text elements
- **Emphasis Color**: Choose a color for emphasized (italic) text
- **Code Color**: Choose a color for inline code elements

Each color dropdown includes:
- "Auto (from palette)" option - Uses intelligent heuristics to select colors based on color names
- All available colors from the current palette, backgrounds, and accents

Selected colors are persisted in localStorage and will be remembered across sessions.

### 2. Custom Text Length

In addition to the existing preset options (Short, Medium, Long), users can now:

- Select "Custom" from the Length dropdown
- Enter a specific word count (5-500 words) for generated text
- Get real-time statistics showing total words, characters, and average words per paragraph

## Usage

### Setting Custom Colors

1. Navigate to the Scientific Color Analysis section
2. Click on the "Lorem Ipsum" tab
3. Locate the color control section (displayed in a styled panel)
4. Select your desired colors from the dropdown menus:
   - **Heading Color**: Color applied to "Sample Heading"
   - **Strong Color**: Color applied to bold text
   - **Emphasis Color**: Color applied to italic text
   - **Code Color**: Color applied to code snippets
5. Changes are applied immediately and visible in the preview below

### Setting Custom Text Length

1. In the Lorem Ipsum Analyzer, select "Custom" from the Length dropdown
2. A "Custom Length (words)" input field will appear
3. Enter a value between 5 and 500 words
4. The generated text will update immediately
5. Statistics will update to reflect the new text length

## Technical Details

### Implementation

The component uses Vue 3's Composition API with:
- Reactive refs for color selections and custom word count
- Computed properties for available colors and preview styles
- localStorage for persisting user preferences
- CSS custom properties for dynamic styling

### Color Selection Logic

```typescript
// Colors are populated from all available sources
const availableColors = computed(() => {
  const all = [
    ...(props.palette ?? []),
    ...(props.backgrounds ?? []),
    ...(props.accents ?? []),
  ];
  // Deduplicate by hex value
  const seen = new Set<string>();
  return all.filter(c => {
    if (seen.has(c.hex)) return false;
    seen.add(c.hex);
    return true;
  });
});
```

### Custom Length Implementation

```typescript
function buildParagraph(seed: string, len: 'short' | 'medium' | 'long' | 'custom') {
  const base = seed.split(' ');
  let words: number;
  if (len === 'custom') {
    words = Math.max(5, customWordCount.value);
  } else {
    const mult = len === 'short' ? 0.7 : len === 'long' ? 1.6 : 1.0;
    words = Math.max(6, Math.round(base.length * mult));
  }
  // ... build paragraph
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Testing**: Preview text with specific color combinations to test readability and aesthetics
2. **Flexible Content**: Generate text of any length to test layouts with varying content volumes
3. **Better UX**: Persistent color selections save time and provide a personalized experience
4. **Visual Feedback**: Real-time updates and statistics help users make informed decisions

## Browser Compatibility

The feature uses standard web APIs and should work in all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Color picker UI for more precise color selection
- Ability to save and load color presets
- Export styled Lorem Ipsum text
- Additional text statistics (reading time, syllable count, etc.)
